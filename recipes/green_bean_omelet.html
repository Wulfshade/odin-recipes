  <h3>Description</h3>
  <P>
    This Green Bean Omelet is a quick and easy meal that you can serve for breakfast, lunch, or even dinner. In most Western countries, eggs are usually reserved for breakfast. But in Asian cuisine, eggs can be added to many meals and are often enjoyed at dinner.  It’s easy to customize the recipe as you want and you can make it with any veggies you have on hand.

  <p>
    The green beans are cooked only slightly to give crunch, while the egg adds flavor and protein. To make it, you simply add eggs, a bit of flour, and seasoning to chopped green beans, and bake it in a large frying pan. Serve it with a side of rice and dinner can be ready in less than an hour! It’s the perfect midweek dinner idea!
