    Love lasagna, but want to add more veggies? Cabbage lasagna is a wonderful way to,make the classic dish healthier and more budget-friendly.

  <p>
    The filling between the pasta sheets is a fragrant mixture of cabbage, bacon, and caraway seeds, and you can use store-bought bechamel sauce or make your own. Gruyere cheese or shredded mozzarella add the finishing touches to this tasty and healthier version of lasagna.

    <li>ALL PURPOSE FLOUR <strong></strong>3 tbsp / 35g</strong></li>
    <li>WHOLE MILK <strong></strong>2 cups / 500ml</strong></li>
    <li>SALT, PEPPER <strong></strong>to taste</strong></li>
    <li>NUTMEG <strong></strong>pinch</strong></li>

  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Cut the bacon into small pieces (or buy ready-cut bacon lardons) and slowly render out the fat over medium to low heat until the bits start to brown.</li>
    <li>While the bacon cooks, remove the outer leaves of the cabbage and cut into quarters. Then remove the stem and then cut into 1/2-inch strips. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Peel and dice the onion then set aside.</li>
    <li>When the bacon is done, use a slotted spoon to lift it out of the pan and place it on a paper towel to drain the excess fat off. Use another paper towel to wipe the fat out of the pan.</li>
    <li>Heat the ghee in the cleaned pan over medium heat. Sautee the onions for about 2 – 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Add the cabbage and cook for 5 minutes or so until it starts to soften. Add the caraway seeds to the cabbage, then season with salt and pepper and add the vinegar and broth.</li>
    <li>Cover and braise over low heat until the cabbage is tender – around 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Pour everything into a large bowl once cooked and set aside while making the bechamel. If you’ve bought ready-made bechamel, skip the sauce-making step below and add the bacon bits and cabbage to the ready-made sauce.</li>
    <li>Clean the pan with a paper towel again, then put onto the stove and melt the butter.</li>
    <li>When the butter is melted, stir in the flour, and cook for about 1 – 2 minutes. Add the milk and any remaining cooking liquid from the cabbage to the flour and butter mixture, while whisking all the time. Bring everything to a boil while stirring. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.</li>
    <li>When the sauce has thickened, add in the bacon bits and the cabbage, and stir everything to combine.</li>
    <li>Layer the lasagne sheets and the cabbage in an oven proof dish, beginning and ending with cabbage. Grate the cheese and sprinkle over the dish.</li>
    <li>Bake in a preheated oven at 375F/170C fan/gas mark 5 for 30 – 45 minutes, until the top is golden brown and bubbling.</li>
    <li>Let rest for 20 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
  </ol>
